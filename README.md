# AutomaticText
An Android app to automatically text emergency your location right after your phone call. The best use case for this is calling an emergency number, such as 911, and then after ending the call, AutomaticText will send them your exact location (within a block) via text message. It needs location service to be on for the location to be retrieved. In future implementations, I plan on caching locations whenever to be able to show some location even when it is off. Standard carrier rates apply and texting emergency contacts has to be enabled in your area
